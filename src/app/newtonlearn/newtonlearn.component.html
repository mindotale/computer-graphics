        <br><br>1. Definition:<br><br>

        A Newton fractal is a type of fractal generated by iterating a simple iterative root-finding algorithm using Newton's method.
        Newton's method is an iterative numerical technique for finding roots (solutions) of a real-valued function.
        
        <br><br>2. Iterative Process:<br><br>
        
        To generate a Newton fractal, one starts with an initial guess for the root of a given function.
        The iteration formula is applied to refine the guess and converge towards the actual root.
        The process is repeated for each point in a complex plane, and the behavior of the iterations is visualized.
     
        <br><br>3. Visualization:<br><br>
        
        The complex plane is divided into a grid of points, and for each point, the iteration is performed.
        Colors are assigned based on the behavior of the iteration. Points that converge to a root are often colored differently from those that diverge or exhibit chaotic behavior.
        
        <br><br>4. Features of Newton Fractals:<br><br>
        
        Newton fractals can exhibit intricate and aesthetically pleasing patterns with regions of both order and chaos.
        The shape of the fractal is influenced by the choice of the function 
        f(z) and the initial conditions.
        Different functions lead to different fractal patterns.
        
        <br><br>5. Color Mapping:<br><br>
        
        The colors in a Newton fractal image represent the number of iterations it takes for a point to converge or diverge.
        Color gradients or distinct color schemes are often used to enhance the visual appeal.
        
        <br><br>6. Applications:<br><br>
        
        Newton fractals are primarily a mathematical curiosity and a way to visualize complex root-finding behavior.
        They are used in educational contexts to illustrate mathematical concepts and algorithms.
        They also have aesthetic applications in digital art due to their visually striking patterns.
        
        <br><br>7. Famous Newton Fractal: Mandelbrot Set:<br><br>
        
        The Mandelbrot set, while not a Newton fractal per se, is closely related. It is a set of complex numbers for which the corresponding Newton iterations remain bounded.
        
        <br><br>8. Challenges and Exploration:<br><br>
        
        Exploring different functions and initial conditions can lead to a variety of fractal patterns, offering a rich space for experimentation.
        Implementing Newton fractals can be a rewarding coding exercise, and various programming languages are used for this purpose.
